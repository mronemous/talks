How to write plugin?

  BluetoothSerial - demo

  Java = native imp
  Javascript = Interface (only one)
  config - metadata to associate string id with native class

  config.xml
    <feature name="BluetoothSerial"> //id
        //native plugin class
        <param name="android-package" value="com.megster.cordova.BluetoothSerial" />
    </feature>

  Javascript
                                    id                 method   parameters
    cordova.exec( success, failure, "BluetoothSerial", "write", [data] )

  Java

    package com.megster.cordova;
    ...

    public class BluetoothSerial extends CordovaPlugin {

      private static final String WRITE = "write";
      private static final String IS_ENABLED = "isEnabled";
      ...

      @Override
      public boolean execute(String action, CordovaArgs args, CallbackContext callbackContext) throws JSONException {

        if (action.equals(WRITE)) {

            String data = args.getString(0);
            bluetoothSerialService.write(data.getBytes());
            callbackContext.success();
        }
        else if (action.equals(IS_ENABLED)) {

            if (bluetoothAdapter.isEnabled()) {
                callbackContext.success();
            } else {
                callbackContext.error("Bluetooth is disabled.");
            }

        }
        ...
      }
    }
